# TailGate-App-Code-Java
Code written at LA Hacks, meant to pair with a radar device. The code takes radar data and tells the user/autonomous car whether they need to back up (they are talgating) or speed up as they are trailing behind (meant to help with traffic conjestion). Designed to eliminate fender bender accidents, and optimize car speed. Can pair with separate device or the computer of a smart car. Program uses recommended data from the DMV
